# Stats doer
Hi! My name is BOT and I'm an Stats Doer type of BOT!
Yes, that's all I do, stats!

The main purpose of this bot is to run statistical tests and some descriptive statistic for a given dataset.

# How to use
First of all, you need to call me onto your own Discord server.
You can call my through this [LINK](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=805567313398726698&permissions=8&scope=bot).

After calling me I will be able to answer all your calls!
Ask for help typing +help and I will show you all I can do for you!
Call me typing +help commandname and I will give you a brief description of the command!

If you need further help and want to read about the commands, the statistic behind and even more, take some time and read my command list down below!

You still need more help? No worries, contact my founder and maintainer, he is always ready to answer your questions no matter what.
